# MRacing Cone Detection (Autonomous)

## Roadmap

- [ ] How to train?
  
  - [ ] YOLO
    
    - [ ] PyTorch or TF?
  
  - [ ] TF SSD
  
  - [ ] ~~PyTorch SSD~~

- [ ] **Find**/Make Dataset (all kinds of cones)

- [ ] Train

- [ ] Build Inference Engine
  
  - [ ] Lower resolution on training videos
  
  - [ ] Inference 
    
    - [ ] Start w/Python ([OpenCV](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov4-with-cuda-powered-opencv-dnn-2fef48ea3984))
    
    - [ ] Port to C++ (OpenCV)
