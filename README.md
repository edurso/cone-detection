# MRacing Cone Detection (Autonomous)

## Roadmap

- [ ] How to train?
  
  - [x] YOLO
    
    - [x] PyTorch or TF?
      * v7
  
  - [ ] ~~TF SSD~~
  
  - [ ] ~~PyTorch SSD~~

- [x] **Find**/Make Dataset (all kinds of cones)
  
  * popular set: https://github.com/ddavid/fsoco

- [x] Train

- [ ] Build Inference Engine
  
  - [ ] Lower resolution on training videos
  
  - [ ] Inference 
    
    - [ ] Start w/Python ([OpenCV](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov4-with-cuda-powered-opencv-dnn-2fef48ea3984))
    
    - [ ] Port to C++ (OpenCV)
